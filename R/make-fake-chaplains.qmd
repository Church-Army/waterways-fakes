## Intro

We'd like to mock up a working example of a proposed data collection solution. That means mocking up responses and responders.

## Libraries

```{r libraries}
library(conflicted)

library(here)
library(fs)

library(dplyr)
conflicted::conflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)
library(randomNames)
```

## Generate random names

```{r generate_random_names}
set.seed(1992)

n_names <- 15

first_names <- randomNames(n_names, ethnicity = 5, which.names = "first")
last_names  <- randomNames(n_names, ethnicity = 5, which.names = "last")
```
